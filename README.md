# The Discrete-Linear-Computing (DLC) project

The DLC project is a personal attempt to master the individual content and connections between three areas:

- Discrete mathematics
- Linear algebra
- Computer science (including data science)

I consider these to be the foundations of the next generation of mathematics to be studied at the undergraduate level. This repo contains files used for my personal learning as well as prototypes of educational materials.
